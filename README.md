#Image search
A Search engine built using python which does search by meta data. Meta data in this case, is the caption of the image which user uploads. 

* Uses code from Neuraltalk repository to caption the images :x:
* Uses Elastic Search to search the descriptions :white_check_mark:
* Uses Django as it's web development framework :soon:
